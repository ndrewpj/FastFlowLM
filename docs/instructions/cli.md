# ⚡ CLI (Interactive Mode)

FastFlowLM offers a terminal-based interactive experience, similar to Ollama, but fully offline and accelerated excusively on AMD NPUs.

---

## 🔧 Pre-Run PowerShell Commands

### 🆘 Show Help

```powershell
flm help
```

### 🚀 Run a Model

Run a model interactively from the terminal:

```powershell
flm run llama3.2:1B

```powershell
flm pull llama3.2:3B
```

### 📦 List Downloaded Models

```powershell
flm list
```

### ❌ Remove a Downloaded Model

Delete a model from local storage:

```

### 📄 Run with a Text File

Load input from a local text file:

```powershell
flm run llama3.2:1B "C:\Users\Public\Desktop\alice_in_wonderland.txt"
```

---

### 🌐 Start Server Mode

Launch FastFlowLM as a local REST API server (also support OpenAI API):
