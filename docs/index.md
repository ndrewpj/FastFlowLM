## 🧪 Test Drive (Remote Demo)

🚀 Don’t have a Ryzen™ AI PC? Instantly try FastFlowLM on a live AMD Ryzen™ AI 5 340 NPU with 32 GB memory ([spec](https://www.amazon.com/4X4-BOX-AI340-Display-Support-Copilot/dp/B0F2GFLF67/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1X16RDUCQ2497&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.C5GS4xMl_kkJ7Yr6dNFi6g.Dfj_l9Dk1yuIBjppqmKSqNAAPQc1F4Mu3zJ9-MDlszw&dib_tag=se&keywords=4x4+box+ai340&qid=1752010554&sprefix=www.amazon.com%2F4X4-BOX-AI340%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-5)) — no setup needed.  

✨ Now with **Gemma3:4b (the first NPU-only VLM!)** supported here.

📺 [Watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AhkX2ZLu7Y&list=PLf87s9UUZrJp4r3JM4NliPEsYuJNNqFAJ&index=2) to see how to try the remote demo in just a few clicks.

> Alternatively, **sign up** with your own credentials instead of using the shared guest account.
> ⚠️ Some universities or companies may **block access** to the test drive site. If it doesn't load over Wi-Fi, try switching to a **cellular network**.  
> Real-time demo powered by **FastFlowLM + Open WebUI** — no downloads, no installs.  
> Try optimized LLM models: `gemma3:4b`, `qwen3:4b`, etc. — all accelerated on NPU.

⚠️ **Please note**:  
- FastFlowLM is designed for **single-user local use**. This remote demo machine may experience short wait times when **multiple users** access it concurrently — please be patient.
- When switching models, it may take longer time to replace the model in memory.
- Large prompts (30k+ tokens) and VLM (gemma3:4b) may take longer — but it works! 🙂
